### 1. System Overview:
- **Unity Platform**: A decentralized application (DApp) facilitating cross-DAO governance.
- **Funds Pool**: A smart contract managing the communal pool of tokens.
- **DAO Registry**: A smart contract maintaining the list of member DAOs.
- **Proposal System**: A mechanism for submitting, mirroring, voting, and executing funding proposals.

### 2. Key Components:
#### a. Unity Smart Contract:
- Manages the integration of member DAOs and the communal funds pool.
- Functions: Register/Remove DAOs, Initiate Proposals, Aggregate Votes, Execute Funding.

#### b. Funds Pool Contract:
- Holds and manages shared tokens.
- Functions: Deposit/Withdraw Tokens, Allocate Funds to Approved Proposals.

#### c. DAO Registry Contract:
- Keeps track of member DAOs.
- Functions: Add/Remove DAOs, Validate DAO Membership.

#### d. Proposal Contract:
- Manages funding proposals.
- Functions: Create Proposal, Mirror to DAOs, Collect Votes, Determine Outcome.

### 3. Workflow:
1. **Proposal Submission**: Any entity submits a proposal to Unity, specifying a wallet and token amount.
2. **Proposal Mirroring**: Unity mirrors the proposal to all member DAOs.
3. **Voting**: Each DAO votes on the proposal through its internal governance mechanism.
4. **Vote Aggregation**: Unity aggregates votes from all DAOs.
5. **Decision Execution**: If >50% votes are in favor, funds are allocated to the specified wallet.

### 4. Architectural Choices:
- **Decentralized and Modular**: Ensures resilience and flexibility.
- **Smart Contract-Based**: Facilitates trustless operation and automated enforcement.
- **Mirrored Voting**: Preserves DAO autonomy while enabling collaborative decision-making.
- **Simple Majority Rule**: Facilitates clear and efficient decision-making.

### 5. Assumptions:
- DAOs are autonomous entities with internal governance mechanisms.
- DAOs can interact with smart contracts (e.g., voting).
- The blockchain network supports smart contract functionality (e.g., Ethereum, Cosmos).
- Adequate security measures (e.g., multisig wallets, audit trails) are in place.

This specification provides a foundational framework for Unity. It balances autonomy of individual DAOs with collective decision-making, leveraging blockchain technology for decentralized governance. The modular design allows for adaptability and scalability, accommodating various DAO structures and blockchain networks.
