### 1. System Overview:
- **Unity Governance Hub**: A minimalistic platform for proposal management and DAO coordination.
- **Shared Funds Contract**: A straightforward smart contract for managing the communal token pool.
- **Member DAOs**: Individual DAOs with existing governance mechanisms.

### 2. Key Components:
#### a. Unity Governance Hub:
- Basic web interface for proposal submissions and status tracking.
- Simple integration with existing DAO governance systems.

#### b. Shared Funds Contract:
- Manages the pooled tokens with basic functions for deposit, withdrawal, and fund allocation.

#### c. Member DAOs:
- Maintain their existing governance structures.
- Interface with Unity for proposal voting and updates.

### 3. Workflow:
1. **Proposal Submission**: Proposals are submitted directly to Unity Governance Hub.
2. **Notification to DAOs**: Unity notifies member DAOs of new proposals via email or existing communication channels.
3. **Independent DAO Voting**: DAOs vote internally and submit their decision to Unity.
4. **Result Compilation**: Unity tallies the votes manually or through a simple script.
5. **Funds Distribution**: If approved, Unity authorizes the Shared Funds Contract to disburse funds.

### 4. Architectural Choices:
- **Lean Interface**: Focuses on essential functions for efficiency and ease of use.
- **Manual Integration**: Utilizes existing communication methods for DAO notifications.
- **Independent DAO Processes**: Leverages existing DAO governance systems to reduce complexity.
- **Simplified Fund Management**: A straightforward smart contract for token handling.

### 5. Assumptions:
- DAOs are willing to participate in a manual or semi-manual process.
- Existing communication channels (e.g., email, messaging apps) are reliable for DAO notifications.
- The blockchain network supports basic smart contract functionalities.
- Member DAOs can independently record and communicate their votes to Unity.

### 6. Diagram:
A basic diagram will illustrate the proposal flow from submission to fund distribution, highlighting the interactions between Unity, member DAOs, and the Shared Funds Contract.

This second specification is designed for practicality and ease of implementation, minimizing the time and technical complexity involved. It leverages existing DAO governance mechanisms and communication channels, focusing on essential functionalities to facilitate cross-DAO collaboration.
